README - db_create
-----------------------------------

Container for all utilities needed to create the actual SPTDB (database of
FAS spectra to be used as input for inversion).

create/update list (=parsers): call parsers to read event, station, pick data and store
them in the progressive lists (or update them if they already exist, TODO)

step1: parse the progressive lists together with the associated original data
(and metadata, if traces are uncorrected) and create the WFPOOL with
all available traces for each event (both for Swave signal and noise, 
and for two horizontal components)

step2: parse the WFPOOL and apply a set of contraints (SNR, nevsmin, nstamin,
hypodist) through a recursive filter. Create corresponding lists of 
events and stations selected for inversion.

step3: parse the lists of selected events and stations and process the 
corresponding data to create SPTDB, the database containing all spectra 
selected for inversion.


All reference paths are shared and defined inside the utils tool 'config.py'
(home folder, location of input/output files, location of 
parameter files, name of the run...).
